      <h1>Gaming</h1>
      <h2>What is Gaming</h2>
      <li>
          Gaming is like reading books or watching a film. In games you can be whatever you want and experience for exmaple
          the beautiful land of Rome or the history of the prehistoric times. In some games you can tell a story or be in an adventure and in other you are just casually playing.
      </li>
      <h2>What can we expect for gaming in the future</h2>
      <li>
          Technology is going crazy. Even virtual reality exists in the meantime.
          So the expectations are high that something like "full dive virtual reality" will happen in the future.
      </li>
      <h2>Why are some people against gaming</h2>
      <li>
          In the last time there were many newspaper reports about rampages from young people who played shooter games.
          So the majority thinks that is the reason why something like this happens. One of the biggest misunderstandings is that people are thinking the monitors or games
          cause damage to the eyes or to the brain but thats exactly the opposite.
      </li>
      <h2>What is E-Sports and why does it exist</h2>
      <li>
          Just like any other sport E-Sport is also a sport and there are many events about it. Wehther it is a convention or a tournament with a large price pool.
          There are also international teams all around the world. The fanbase of these events are very big because there are so many people who love gaming
          and like watching other people playing video games.
      </li>
      <h2>What are the advantages of gaming?</h2>
      <li>
          For gaming you need reaction time and you train your brain constantly which is really good for programming or maths.
          But do not overdo it! You can also learn a lot of new things for example in games
          where you need to explore the empire of rome or defeat spartans in greek.
          One big call for gaming is that you also meet new people and friends which is kinda funny.
      </li>
      <h2>What are the disadvantages of gaming?</h2>
      <li>
          How it was brought before up you can overdo it and there are people who already forget to eat or to sleep
          so in this case stay focused. There could be an addiction of playing video games and to avoid it you could
          go for a little walk or meet friends. Some students also forget their homework and thats not nice.
      </li>
      <h2>Is gaming something for you?</h2>
      <li>
          Gaming is for everybody a option because of the large scope of genres
          like Jump and Runs, Shooter, Strategy Games, etc. There is something for every person. And you might be able to find that game here!
