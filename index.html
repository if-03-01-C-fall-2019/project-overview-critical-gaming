      <li>Future Plans</li>
      <p>
        We want to utilize two accounts. You will be able to choose between user and developer.
        There will be different functions for each account.<br>
        Disclamer for the teacher:   We know that you arent allowed to make buttons that redirect so we just made them useless.      
      </p>

      <li>Plans for now</li>
      <p>
        We have planned to make one tab per game. The tab should have pictures and videos of the game, a decription of it and one Update pannel
        where users can read about the newest feature of their favorite game. They will also be able to write a review and give the game a score (1-10)
        We want to make this webite because we want to have one reviewing site only for games. As far as we know there is no dedicated gaming review site.
        So our goal is to have gaming review ite where you can tell if a game is good or a site where you allways can be up to date.  
      </p>
      <li>Developer</li>
      <p>
        So the major difference from dev to user is that you can upload your own game and write articels about the latest updates or the events they have planned.
        Developer will not be able to write reviews but will be able to respond to questions, reviews and comments.
        Now we all know that there will be some trolls that want to pose as a developer. That is why we will review them manually and give them then the permission
        to write one articel about their games(wich will also be reviewed manually) 
        Changes to the Dev account will propably happen
      </p>
      <li>User</li>
      <p> 
        Users will have the ability to write rewiews and read articel and rewiews. They will also be able to give a score(1-10)
        We will also have a comment section where you can discuss with other players about stuff. Now one of our features will also involve a wishlist. The User will be able to
        add games to their wishlist and receive the latest news about their games.
