      <h2>What is Gaming</h2>
      <p>
          Gaming is like reading books or watching a film.<br>
          In games you can be whatever you want and experience for exmaple<br>
          the beautiful land of Rome or the history of the prehistoric times.<br>
          In some games you can tell a story<br>
          or be in an adventure and in other you are just casually playing.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h2>What can we expect for gaming in the future</h2>
      <p>
          Technology is going crazy. Even virtual reality exists in the meantime.<br>
          So the expectations are high that something<br>
          like "full dive virtual reality" will happen in the future.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h2>Why are some people against gaming</h2>
      <p>
          In the last time there were many newspaper reports about rampages<br>
          from young people who played shooter games.<br>
          So the majority thinks that is the reason why something like this happens.<br>
          One of the biggest misunderstandings is that people are thinking the monitors or games<br>
          cause damage to the eyes or to the brain but thats exactly the opposite.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h2>What is E-Sports and why does it exist</h2>
      <p>
          Just like any other sport E-Sport is also a sport and there are many events about it.<br>
          Wehther it is a convention or a tournament with a large price pool.<br>
          There are also international teams all around the world.<br>
          The fanbase of these events are very big because there are so many people who love gaming<br>
          and like watching other people playing video games.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h2>What are the advantages of gaming?</h2>
      <p>
          For gaming you need reaction time and you train your brain constantly<br>
          which is really good for programming or maths.<br>
          But do not overdo it! You can also learn a lot of new things for example in games<br>
          where you need to explore the empire of rome or defeat spartans in greek.<br>
          One big call for gaming is that you also meet new people and friends which is kinda funny.
      </p>

      <h2>What are the disadvantages of gaming?</h2>
      <p>
          How it was brought before up you can overdo it and there are people<br>
          who already forget to eat or to sleep so in this case stay focused.<br>
          There could be an addiction of playing video games and to avoid it you could<br>
          go for a little walk or meet friends. Some students also forget their homework and thats not nice.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h2>Is gaming something for you?</h2>
      <p>
          Gaming is for everybody a option because of the large scope of genres<br>
          like Jump and Runs, Shooter, Strategy Games, etc.<br>
          There is something for every person.<br>
          And you might be able to find that game here!
