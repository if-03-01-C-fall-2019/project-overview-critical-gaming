        <i> (Plans for now)<br>
            For now we want to make the site itself where’s a picture of the game and a <br>
            description and an Update panel where the users can read informations <br>
            of the game and also give a like or dislike. The whole Website is there to inform people about games and <br>
            hold them Up-To-Date. All in all that’s everything the Website is about <br>
            <br>
            (FuturePlans that are not for now)<br>
            We are programming a website where you can choose make a user or a developer account. <br>
            There are many options which are different to the account you are identified as. Down below you can see the functions <br>
            which are planned or already in the website. We know that are not suppose to make buttons with functions on this state of time but we want to make a log in panel for the various users and want to save them on an online server. <br>
            But that’s for later on. <br>

      <br>
      <li>Developer functions</li>
        <i> The major difference between developer and user is that the developer can upload games and write a description for it <br>
            and can hold the update panel Up-To-Date. Many people would read the descriptions and also the update panels. <br>
            If there will be a comment function, then users would also write short comments for critic or other things. <br>
            It is sure that there will be some trolls that’s why they’re going to be checkt with an algorithm. <br>
            <br>
            The permissions are there to organise the whole website. To defend raids of accounts there are some sub permissions. <br>
            More ideas for the developer role will be added. <br>
        </i>
      <br>
      <li>Normal User functions</li>
        <i> The big function of a user is that you are free on the entire website<br>
            and aware of rating other developer and have diskusions<br>
            in the comment section with other users. There will be also a Wishlist<br>
            for your wishes.<br>
